              Welcome to DisasterMatch. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your
              access to and use of the DisasterMatch website, products, and
              services. By accessing or using our platform, you agree to be bound
              by these Terms.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-indigo-600">1. Who May Use the Service</h2>
            <p>
              You must be at least 18 years old to register for an account or purchase content on DisasterMatch. By using the Service you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 and have legal capacity to enter into these Terms.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
             The Service is available to any individual or business. DisasterMatch’s intended audience includes contractors working with insurance companies, but anyone may create an account and purchase incident data cards.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-indigo-600">2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>
              DisasterMatch aggregates and presents incident data ("Incident Cards" or "Cards") that are compiled from third-party sources, including paid third‑party websites and public emergency call records. Each Card displays information such as state, city, a short description, date and time, and an indication whether the Card is “complete” or “incomplete.”
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              When you purchase a Card, DisasterMatch delivers the information associated with that Card to the email address you provide during checkout (for example, purchase confirmation and incident details as in the sample email included on our site).
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
                A Card marked complete indicates DisasterMatch has captured all key fields for that incident. A Card marked incomplete means one or more key data fields (for example: phone, email, or address) are missing; incomplete Cards are priced lower.
            </p>
          </section>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-indigo-600">3. Account Registration and Security</h2>
            <p>
             To use certain features you must create an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information and to update it as needed. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
                You may not share account credentials, and you agree not to transfer or sell your account without DisasterMatch’s prior written consent.
                </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-indigo-600">4. Purchases, Payment, and Invoicing</h2>
            <p>
              All purchases are one‑time purchases for the specific Card(s) bought. We do not offer subscriptions or commission-based arrangements by default.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
           By purchasing a Card you authorize DisasterMatch to charge the payment method provided. You are responsible for any applicable taxes. After purchase, DisasterMatch will send a confirmation email and an invoice (when applicable) to the email address you supply. The confirmation email will contain the details of the purchased incidents.
           </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                No refunds. All purchases are final and non-refundable once the incident details are delivered to you. To the fullest extent permitted by law, purchases are non-refundable even if the information later proves to be inaccurate or incomplete.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-indigo-600">5. Use of Incident Data and Restrictions</h2>
            <p>
                The data you purchase is licensed to you for your lawful business use only. You may not:
                <br />

- Represent that DisasterMatch guarantees the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any incident data.
<br/>

            <p>
                DisasterMatch compiles Cards from third‑party sources, including paid third‑party websites and public emergency call records. While DisasterMatch endeavors to obtain and present information accurately, we do not control these third‑party sources and cannot guarantee their accuracy, completeness, or reliability.

            <p>
                DisasterMatch is not an emergency response service. The Service does not monitor incidents in real time for the purpose of dispatching emergency services. If you or someone else is in immediate danger, call the local emergency number (e.g., 9‑1‑1 in the United States) immediately. Do not rely on DisasterMatch to respond to or handle emergencies.
